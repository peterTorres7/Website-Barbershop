The price is good for the location and even with a generous tip, the cost is still $10 cheaper than most places around Cap Hill to get a clip. Sometimes a line, but Lan's efficiency cuts through it in no time. Her style is gentle and I often feel myself nodding off despite the scissors and clippers right next to my face."</blockquote>
